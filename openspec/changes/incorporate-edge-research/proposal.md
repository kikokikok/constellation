# Change: Incorporate Edge Research into Constellation Architecture

## Why
Current Constellation implementation lacks cutting-edge research insights that address fundamental limitations in autonomous AI systems. Recent research provides solutions for data lineage tracking, security in agentic protocols, hybrid architectures, measurable autonomy scales, and emergent discovery patterns.

## What Changes
- **ADD** Data Transformation Graph (DTG) architecture for skill execution and error tracing
- **ADD** Model Context Protocol (MCP) security with cryptographic provenance and intent verification
- **ADD** Hybrid agent architecture combining LLM strategists with SLM/rule-based executors
- **ADD** Kardashev-style Autonomous AI Scale with 10 capability axes and κ measurement
- **ADD** Open-world research environment for emergent collaboration and discovery
- **ADD** Self-assessment and self-feedback mechanisms for autonomous error correction
- **ADD** Cross-data-source verification agents with transparent query provenance
- **MODIFY** Agent communication to include context validation and tool call provenance
- **BREAKING** Shift from control-centric to data-centric execution models

## Impact
- Affected specs: agent-a2a-protocol, agent-harness, agent-skills, multi-agent-research
- Affected code: Complete architectural overhaul with DTG, MCP security, hybrid agents
- Performance: Improved error tracing, security validation, emergent discovery
- Research capability: State-of-the-art autonomous scientific discovery
- Business autonomy: Measurable progress toward AGI-scale capabilities
